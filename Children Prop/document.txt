 I chose a grid layout for the gallery because it's like arranging images on a shelf. It keeps everything neat and organized, no matter how many pictures you have. This layout makes it easy for you to see all the images at once, without any of them looking squished or out of place. Plus, if you add more images, the grid adjusts automatically to fit them in nicely. It's a clean, efficient way to show off your photos!
